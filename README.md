# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you play against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions, ensuring it never loses. The game alternates between a human player and the AI, where the human plays as 'O' and the AI plays as 'X'. 

## Features
- Play against an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax** algorithm.
- The AI makes the best possible move every time.
- A simple console-based interface to play the game.
- Checks for win conditions and draws after every move.

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your move as `row column` (e.g., `1 1`) where `row` and `column` are integers from `0` to `2`.
3. The AI will make its move automatically after your turn.
4. The game ends when there is a winner (either you or the AI) or the board is full (a draw).

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your computer.

### Steps to Run the Game:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
